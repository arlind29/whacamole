Easy Implementation of whacamole game via Solara library

The whacamole is a famous game where one has to click on the moles appearing on the screen. For every mole that is missed there is a penalty and for every mole that is hit the user makes points. 

I provide here an easy implementation via solara library, that makes the game development much easier. One defines in one place the visual and logic of the game, without having to implement complex synchronization of logic and variables from front-end to back-end (client-server communication).
